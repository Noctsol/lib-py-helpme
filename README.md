# lib-py-helpu
Phonetic - *| help juː |*

Library on PYPI that contains some very lazy mode methods.
Because who actually wants to do any work?

Use case example:
```
import helpme

data_lists = [["header1", "header2"], ["value1", "value3"]]
file_path = "C:\yourfile.csv"

helpme.write_to_csv(file_path, data_lists)
```

Examples of functions:
```
def write_to_csv(self, file_path, lists):

def timestamp(self, formatting="%Y%m%d"):
```



It's a tradition.
